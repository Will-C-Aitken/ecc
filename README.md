# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Implementation of common elliptic curve elgamal cryptography functions including:
* keygen
* encrypt
* decrypt
* encode character onto curve
* decode point off curve to character

**NOTE: Proof of concept - has not been tested for security**

Uses secp256k1 standard curve and handles plaintext one character at a time. Run `main.py` for sample execution
